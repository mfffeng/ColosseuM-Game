### Report Grade (42.25/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

Technical Approach: appropriate heuristics (performant, sensible) and pruning to make min-max viable. Clear evidence of experimentation/optimization.
Motivation for Technical Approach: Good explanation of heuristics, but could use more motivation for minmax as opposed to any other approach
Pros/cons of Chosen Approach: Correct analysis, pros could use more detail/explanation (why is your implementation straight-forward"? How does it scale to larger boards exactly? How accurate is it?). Similar for cons "why was it not difficult to cut the agent off?)"
Future Improvements: good selection of viable alternatives. Each could have more detail explaining how/why they would confer advantage.
Language and Writing: some typos, typesetting, (reverse quotes in latex are backticks ``) and awkward/informal sentences, but overall well written.
Organization: well organized and presented, appropriate amount of content
